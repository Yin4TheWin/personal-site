            <p> Hello, and thank you for visiting my personal webpage!  
                I love creating projects which can both grow my skills and impact communities in a meaningful way. 
                I've compiled some of the work I've done into a portfolio down below, so please check them out if you wish.</p>

                <h3>But first, a shameless plug</h3>
                <p>I've recently launched a new product called Bot Ink, a site which allows users to create custom multi-function Discord bots in just a few clicks! 
                    If you're the owner of a Discord server and looking to grow your brand, <a href="https://botink.dev/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here</a> to get started for just $3.99/month! Or, <a href="mailto:franklinyin.nj@gmail.com">contact me</a> for a one-month free trial.</p>

            <i>Now looking for web developers!</i>
            <p>New Beginnings is a subproject of Rutgers Enactus, a social entreprenurial organization at Rutgers University. Our mission is to help formerly incarcerated individuals secure employment, establish strong relationships with mentors, and gain access to local resources in order to ease their transition from prison.
              I currently serve as the project's Web Dev PL, and would be delighted to get some extra help! If you are a current CS student at Rutgers University looking to make a positive impact on the local community, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or join us on Monday nights at 9:45pm in the College Ave Student Center, Room 411 ABC.

            <p>Each panel represents a personal project I believe is worth showcasing, and contains its name, description, image, and top three technologies used to make it. You may click on a panel to open its project or source code in a new tab.</p>
