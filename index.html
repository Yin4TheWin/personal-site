            <p> Hello, and thank you for visiting my personal webpage!  
                I love creating projects which can both grow my skills and impact communities in a meaningful way. 
                I've compiled some of the work I've done into a portfolio down below, so please check them out if you wish.</p>

                <h3>But first, a shameless plug</h3>
                <p>I've recently launched a new product called Bot Ink, a site which allows users to create custom multi-function Discord bots in just a few clicks! 
                    If you're the owner of a Discord server and looking to grow your brand, <a href="https://botink.dev/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here</a> to get started for just $3.99/month! Or, <a href="mailto:franklinyin.nj@gmail.com">contact me</a> for a one-month free trial.</p>
